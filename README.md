# Professional README Generator

## Description

This application generates a custom professional README file for any new project in a timely manner based on user input when answering a few select questions in the command-line. The application is invoked when the user enters 'node index.js' in their terminal.

The README generated will include a project title and several sections including description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions.

## Usage
